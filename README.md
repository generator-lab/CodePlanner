CodePlanner
===========

A code generator tool for Visual Studio based on T4 &amp; Powershell.

By using the full power of Visual Studio this package will be able to generate a complete backend for you.
You will also get the possibility to generate MVC Controllers for your model as well as RealTime Controller for WebSockets communication.
There are also Scaffolders for JavaScript and the MVVM pattern for both XSockets and regular ASP.NET MVC

For IOC we provide scaffolders for Ninject, different depending on your choice of websockets or http as communication (you can of course have both).
